# Kleinhafen API

This is the API which complements the kleinhafen.ch website. The website sends
contact form messages to the API as POST requests, and the API sends emails
to notify the Kleinhafen crew of those messages.

## Configuration

The SMTP username and password for the emails should be set in
`config/config.js`.

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Development

To start the server, run `node server.js`.

## Production

Production deployments are done using Supervisor. To start the server, simply
run `supervisord`.

To stop the server, kill the PID stored in `supervisord.pid`.
`kill $(cat supervisord.pid)` will suffice to stop the Supervisor instance.
The server itself then probably also needs to be killed â€” find it with
`ps aux | grep node` and kill it with `kill`. Maybe we can improve this
process in the future.
